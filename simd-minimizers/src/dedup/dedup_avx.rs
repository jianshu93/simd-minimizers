// Modification:
// Instead of blending in the 'old' value just before a window and then rotating the lanes,
// we simply do an unaligned read shifted by one value.
// This causes some issues when the first value of that read was overwritten already,
// and so we do this read one iteration ahead, as `nextprev`.
